# SecureVotingSystemwithFaceRecognition
A secure and efficient online voting system powered by Python, Flask, MySQL (XAMPP), and OpenCV, designed to ensure transparency and fraud prevention through real-time face recognition-based voter authentication. The project is structured into three main components: a biometric verification module for validating voters, a voting interface for casting votes securely, and an admin dashboard for managing volunteers, elections, and voter registrations. The use of Flask enables smooth routing and session handling, MySQL ensures reliable data storage, and OpenCV delivers fast, accurate facial recognitionâ€”together forming a streamlined and tamper-resistant digital election solution.
